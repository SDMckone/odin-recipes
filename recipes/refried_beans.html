    <p>
        This easy refried beans recipe is one of my recent favorites. 
        <br>
        They taste great with chips, in a bean burrito, or on their own!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>½ cup finely chopped yellow or white onion (about ½ small onion)</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 cans (15 ounces each) pinto beans, rinsed and drained, or 3 cup cooked pinto beans</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lime juice (about ½ medium lime), to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan over medium heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the onions and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions have softened and are turning translucent, about 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, chili powder and cumin. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in the drained beans and water. Stir, cover and cook for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and remove the lid. Use a potato masher or the back of a fork to mash up about at least half of the beans, until you reach your desired consistency. Continue to cook the beans, uncovered, stirring often, for 3 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the cilantro and lime juice. Taste, and add more salt and lime juice if necessary. If the beans seem dry, add a very small splash of water and stir to combine. Cover until you’re ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
